# Project: Image super-resolution

## Overview
The target of this homework is Image super-resolution.  
Training on Tiny PASCAL VOC dataset with 20 common object classes and trying to detect each segmentation.

## Hardware
The following specs were used to create the original solution.

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080

## Download Official Image
You can download the training and testing dataset from Google Drive.

* CUDA9.0 
* cuDNN5.1
* OpenCV is optional and needed by demo and visualization
* Numpy 1.19.2
* Tqdm 4.51.0
 
You need to create a dictory names 'checkpoints' to save chekpoint.
And a dictory names 'output' to save images.
  
## Usage
Run train.py to start training.   
```
python Training.py
```

Test the model  
```
python Testing.py
```
